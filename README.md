* The C Programming Language
  - Projects were about bit programming and implementation of a hash table
* Practical Aspects of Software Design
  - Projects didn't aim at a developing something difficult, but to try everything connected to software development (mockups, tests, installation wizard etc.)
* Scripting Languages
  - Many smaller projects/tasks on various aspects of Python language

#### 3.semester
* Algorithms 
  - Projects on data structures and their operations (search, insert, update, delete)

#### 4.semester
* Database Systems 
  - Project to learn SQL
* Computer Communications and Networks
  - Projects were to implement a server fot GET|POST requests and a packet sniffer for TCP|UDP
* Principles of Programming Languages
  - Project was kind of continuation of the compiler from previous year. Goal was to parse a pseudoassembler to XML and then interpret the XML as a program while focusing on OOP principles.
* Computer Graphics Principles
  - Project was basically to implement visualization pipeline with all the geometrical transformations etc. The project template is quite big in which we were implementing just some methods, hence not included in this repository.

* The C# Programming Language
  - Project on implementation of a movie database app in WPF with using Scrum managed in MS DevOps
* Machine Learning and Recognition
  - Project was to recognize male from female base on a photo and voice (image and voice recognition)

#### 5.semester
* Information Systems
  - Project required an implementation of an information system with user management. We chose a rock-fest registration system.
* Microprocessors and Embedded Systems
  - Project on self-testing of a microcontroller
* Modelling and Simulation
  - Project was to create a discrete simulator based on processes or events
* Network Applications and Network Administration
  - Project to sniff SSL|TLS communication
* User Interface Programming
  - Project focused on UX design (user research, mockups, UX tests) and implementation of 2 frontend apps on 2 different platforms with the same backend api
* Data Analysis and Visualization in Python
  - Project on data processing (web scraping, preprocessing, analysis, visualisation)

#### 6.semester
* Bachelor's Thesis
  - I had a practical assignment from company Y Soft focusing on anomaly detection.
* Fundamentals of Law
  - No project, just needed last 3 credits :)
