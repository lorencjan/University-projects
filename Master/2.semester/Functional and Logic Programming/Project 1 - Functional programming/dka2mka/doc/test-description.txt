No automatic tests were implemented. There are couple of "look if ok" manual tests

Tests starting with "test-err":
 - handle various erroneous input ... e.g. missing input, incorrect format, FA is not deterministic etc.

Tests starting with "test-i":
 - test if the internal representation is printed out
 - able to parse extra whitespaces

Tests starting with "test-t":
 - test if specific DFA get minimized
