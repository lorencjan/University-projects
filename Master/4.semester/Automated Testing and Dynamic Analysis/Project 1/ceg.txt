Causes:

T1: Before transport request accepted               // timespan before any action ... a request can be refused and still nothing
T2: First minute after transport request accepted   // timespan for normal material to load
T3: Second minute after transport request accepted  // timespan for priority material to load
T4: Too long after transport request                // priority material load timeouts

1: Create a transport request            // initiate transport .... request might get refuse
2: Accept a transport request            // receive and accept a request ... refusal due to slots etc won't make it here
3: Mark material with priority property  // 1 minute expires ... material has priority 

4: Load normal material
5: Load priority material

// requirements for accepting a request
6: A slot available
7: Maximum weight not exceeded
8: Unload_Only state is not selected
9: Can Load


Effects:
R1: Transport request in progress

P1: Priority property is set
P2: State switched to Unload_Only

L1: Normal material loaded
L2: Priority material loaded

N1: No more weight can be loaded

EXC: Throw timeout exception


Rules:
R1 = 1 && 2 && 9

P1 = 3
P2 = T3 && 5

L1 = T2 && 1 && 2 && 4 && 9
L2 = T3 && 1 && 3 && 5 && 9

N1 = !9

EXC = T4

Constraints:
// only 1 time span is active
O: T1, T2, T3, T4

// can load aka would accept request if slots are free, weight does not exceed and is not unload only state
9 -> 6
9 -> 7
9 -> 8
// cart must be available for a request to pass
2 -> 9
// remove unneccesary 6,7,8 combinations for no request
I: 1, 9

// request must exist if it passed
2 -> 1

// in all request active time spans the request must have been made
T2 -> 2
T3 -> 2
T4 -> 2

// once a request is accepted, transport time changes
E: T1, 2

// only 1 typy of material can be loaded
E: 4, 5

// load only in appropriate time interval
4 -> T2
5 -> T3

// if priority time, set priority property ... goes both ways
T3 -> 3
// same goes both ways, but the priority property is set in both T3 and T4
E: T1, 3
E: T2, 3
// but if exception, the priority property is expected
T4 -> 3
