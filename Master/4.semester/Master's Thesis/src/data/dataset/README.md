Contains keyboards and characters datasets generated by scripts in `src/dataset/` directory.  
Furthermore, in `./postprocessing` directory can be found manually annotated keyboard keys for testing post-processing algorithm which should correct recognition results based on layout and keyboard mode. This testing targets especially layout and missing characters (undetected or incorrectly detected).
